IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Pay attention to the relationship directions specified in `from` to `to`. The direction is important! For example, in `{"name": "r", "from": "n1", "to": "n2"}`, the `r` relationship should be from `n1` to `n2` not the other way around.
- Create one and only one Cypher query that satisfies the user query.
- The Cypher query should be valid BASED ON THE SCHEMA and it should return results.
- The node labels and relationship names in the Cypher query MUST EXIST in the schema.
- If you don't know the node label or relationship name, do not include them in the query.
- Instead of creating long MATCH statements such as (a)-[b]-(c)-[d]-(e), break them into multiple MATCH statements. For each, make sure the relationship name and direction are based on the schema.
- Use the schema to validate node and relationship labels and ensure logical consistency.
- Before suggesting the Cypher query, make sure it has valid syntax and semantics.
- Limit to 100 results. (append LIMIT 100 to the Cypher query)
- Always return the "label" value of the return nodes.
- Unless explicitly asked, return only one column (its label value) that satisfies the user query best.
- Generate a Cypher query that considers relationships in both directions, unless it is the best to include the direction to answer the user query.
- Whenever possible, return DISTINCT values.
- Except a Cypher query, return nothing else (no explanation, no comments).
